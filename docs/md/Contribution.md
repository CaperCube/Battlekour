# About
Here is some information about contributions and general guidelines for contributors

# Programming Guidelines
- The target browser compatibility for this project is Chrome. Other browsers are a bonus, though don't get too distracted with IE... unless you really want to.
- Code should be written with collaboation / reuse in-mind, look around for similar features before tackling a new feature / change
- Code reviews can be casual, but features & changes should at least be tested before merging

## Code formatting (I'm open to discussing these)
JS has evolved and we should too, here's some suggestions:
- Clean up dead-code before merging please :)
- Comments on sections and functions are super helpful for collaborators
- `;` are *usually* not needed in JS

## Extra credit code formatting
These aren't stricktly nessesary, but they help keep things clean. 
- Arrow functions are neat, try 'em out sometime! e.g. `() => { doSomething() }`
- Let's try keeping adhering to these cap patterns: `ObjectName` & `functionName()`
- Please avoid using `var`, instead use `const` and `let`
