Tier shaping needed...

# Tasks
- [ ] Better world gen (start putting this in './brain')
    - [X] Live load chunk meshes
    - [X] Save / Load worlds (probably as a .json)
        - [ ] Move these functions inside the "World()" class
- [ ] More work on Noise Tool
    - [ ] Allow users to customize noise patterns
    - [ ] Save patterns for use in new worlds
    - [ ] Possibly add some procedural structure tools?
- [ ] Better chunk rendering performance
    - [X] Combine meshes in chunks (fewer draw calls = more performance)
    - [X] Reduce meshes (remove face that won't be seen)
    - [X] Remove faces from chunk edges that touch
    - [ ] Render meshes base on distance from main camera
        - [ ] Only regenerate modified chunks if it's within the view distance
- [ ] Better input system
    - [X] Keyboard input
    - [ ] Controler input?
    - [ ] Attempt virtual controller for touch devices
- [ ] Menu improvements
    - [X] Pause Menu in-game
    - [ ] Animation support
    - [ ] Text improvements
        - [ ] Custom color
        - [ ] Outline + color option
- [ ] Improved Player
    - [ ] Better raycaster for block selection
    - [ ] Inventory system
    - [ ] Health system (tracked by brain)
    - [ ] Simple weapon
    - [ ] Movement
        - [ ] Running
        - [ ] Better velocity curves
        - [ ] bHopping?
        - [ ] Slopes & sliding?
- [ ] Basic networking
    - [X] Basic event system?
        - [X] Create communication layer to be used to send messages between the client(s) and brain
        - [X] Create the ability to trigger events in the Game object (i.e. add / remove / change block)
    - [ ] Connect to custom URL
        - [ ] Seperate network game server from client server
    - [ ] Send/Receive messages
        - [X] Give new players a playerID
        - [X] New Players / Leaving Players
        - [X] Movement
        - [ ] Chat messages
        - [ ] Privileges
        - [X] Chunk changes
    - [X] Networking for sending / receiving messages
    - [X] Work on generic messages for extendability?
- [ ] Clean & Orginize code
    - [ ] Try moving Babylon.js to only being a module import instead of an html script tag (getting ready for Babylon.js 5.0 in November and its [WebGPU support](https://doc.babylonjs.com/advanced_topics/webGPU))
    - [ ] Replace var & function comments with code-hint comments
        - look at `positionUtils.js` for examples
    - [ ] Start writing some more solid documentation
- [ ] Extra
    - [ ] Lag compensation (There may be a better system than this, this just seemed simple)
        - Clients should store the last received server time-stamp
        - Server should send all entity updates on the same tick / time-stamp
        - Server time-stamps should be stored in an object with message emit times as the stamp names (up to the max allowed ping time, e.g. only store ~ 100 stamps if max allowed ping is 100)
        - Each stamp object (on the server) should contain the message data the server sent to clients
        - When a client sends a request that relies on position, the message should include the client's last received entity time-stamp (for effected entities). If no valid time-stamp is sent, the server should use its newest stamp.
        - The server should then validate by checking the position of the entity at that time-stamp
    - [ ] Block objects (referenced by blockID)
        Props:
        - Block ID
        - Block mesh (if non-cube)
        - Collision shape
        - Interaction function (open-close, move, etc.)
        - Health
        - Friction
        - Bouncieness
        - Possible Directions
        - BasicType "Liquid" "Solid"
        - LiquidViscosity (describes the gravity & speed modifier)
    - [ ] Consider creating a custom `PatternGenerator` class with various seeded 3D noise generators
