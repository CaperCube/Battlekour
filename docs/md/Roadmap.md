# About
This is the master list of tasks we've decided on for the project. If this file get's too lengthy (specifically the tiers), we can create relative links to those files in `docs/md/`. Don't think of this list as set in stone, more as a general direction :)

## Terminology
- `Tier` is a set of features or tasks that can be combined together to help define a milestone for project versions or releases. This will help should non-contributors want to be updated on progress. It also makes tasks feel more manageable and progress feel more tangible.
- `Win condition` is the simplified explination of when a tier should ideally be considered completed.
