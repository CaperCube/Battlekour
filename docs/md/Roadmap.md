# About
This is the master list of tasks we've decided on for the project. If this file get's too lengthy (specifically the tasks), we can create relative links to those files in `docs/md/`. Don't think of this list as set in stone, more as a general direction :)

## Terminology
- `Task` is a set of features or tasks that can be combined together to help define a milestone for project versions or releases. This will help should non-contributors want to be updated on progress. It also makes tasks feel more manageable and progress feel more tangible.
- `Win condition` is the simplified explination of when a task should ideally be considered completed.

## Versioning
The format for version number is as follows:
- **Major Version** . **Minor Version** . **Progress Version** (e.g. 1.03.09)
- `Major Version` should be defined as a sizeable collection of tasks that contribute to a cohesive gameplay experience. (listed with no leading digits)
- `Minor Version` should be defined as a collection of tasks with a particular short-term goal in mind (listed as two digits)
- `Progress Version` should be defined as the number of sub-tasks completed (listed as two digits)
