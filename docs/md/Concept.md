# Survival Mode

## General Concept (Subject to change)
Every world you generate is finiate, has X number of zones, and a portal to leave the planet. Your goal is to enter the portal, though it will either be guarded by a very strong boss, or will require leveled-up parkour skills / equiptment to get to, or both. The typical path to the end would require the player(s) to progress through the world's zones (biomes) and complete each boss / challenge to be able to reach the portal. Once entering the portal, the world is saved (if you want to keep playing in it) and a new (possibly harder) world is generated.

## Goal
Complete all bosses/zones in any order and enter the portal.

## Gameplay Loop
- The world has zones that need to be completed by beating a boss fight, or beating a parkour challenge (or both?)
- Harder bosses or challenges will require higher damage weapons, or up-graded parkour skills.
- Beating earlier zones or grinding will aid the player in crafting better weapons / ammo and upgrading parkour skills.
- Some areas might have zones that change or augment game mechanics (e.g. a "no-build" zone in a parkour challenges).
- The ultimate goal is to beat the last boss and / or challenge

## Zone Types
Some areas might have zones that change or augment game mechanics (e.g. a "no-build" zone in a parkour challenges).
- "No-build"
- "No-break"
- "No-build-or-break"
- "No-weapons"
