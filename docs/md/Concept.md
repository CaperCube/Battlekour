Multiplayer, (proc-gen?), open-world, survival-craft-lite, parkour, shooter

## Game Goal
Complete all bosses/zones in any order (kinda like BotW)
PvP for added replay value?

## Gameplay Loop
- The world has zones that need to be completed by beating a boss fight, or beating a parkour challenge (or both?)
- Harder bosses or challenges will require higher damage weapons, or up-graded parkour skills.
- Beating earlier zones or grinding will aid the player in crafting better weapons / ammo and upgrading parkour skills.
- Some areas might have zones that change or augment game mechanics (e.g. a "no-build" zone in a parkour challenges).
